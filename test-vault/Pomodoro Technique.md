# Pomodoro Technique

A time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a task** - Pick something from [[Projects]]
2. **Set timer for 25 minutes** - Work with full focus ([[Deep Work]])
3. **Take a 5-minute break** - Step away from work
4. **After 4 pomodoros** - Take a longer 15-30 minute break

## Why It Works

The technique leverages:
- Time pressure for increased focus
- Regular breaks to maintain energy
- Clear task boundaries

## My Adaptations

I've modified it based on [[Learning Strategies]]:
- 50-minute work blocks for deep technical work ([[Software Architecture]])
- 10-minute breaks with movement
- Planning pomodoros the night before

## Integration with Other Systems

- Track completed pomodoros in [[Daily Notes]]
- Align with [[Stoicism]] - accepting interruptions gracefully
- Support [[Zettelkasten Method]] - one idea per pomodoro
- Generate [[Ideas]] during break times

## Results

Since implementing this consistently, my productivity has increased significantly. The data is in [[Daily Notes]].
