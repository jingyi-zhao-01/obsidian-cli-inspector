# Software Architecture

Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** - Like the [[Zettelkasten Method]] for code
- **Modularity** - Independent, reusable components
- **SOLID Principles** - Foundation of good OOP design
- **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Architectural Patterns

- Microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Layered architecture
- Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters)

## Connection to Learning

Understanding architecture requires [[Deep Work]] and systematic [[Learning Strategies]]. It's not something you can learn superficially.

## Current Projects

Applying these principles in [[Projects]]:
- Building a CLI tool (this vault indexer!)
- Microservices migration
- API design

## Resources

See [[Book Notes]] for:
- Clean Architecture by Robert Martin
- Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans
- Building Microservices by Sam Newman

Track progress in [[Daily Notes]].
