# Learning Strategies

Effective learning requires deliberate practice and the right techniques.

## Active Learning Techniques

- **Spaced Repetition** - Review material at increasing intervals
- **Retrieval Practice** - Test yourself actively
- **Elaboration** - Explain concepts in your own words
- **Interleaving** - Mix different topics during study sessions

## My Approach

I combine [[Deep Work]] sessions with the [[Zettelkasten Method]] for note-taking. This creates a robust system for knowledge retention.

## Resources

- [[Book Notes]] - Summaries of books on learning
- [[Pomodoro Technique]] - Time management for study sessions
- [[Software Architecture]] - Applying learning to technical topics

## Connection to Other Areas

Learning strategies intersect with:
- [[Stoicism]] - discipline and persistence
- [[Projects]] - practical application
- [[Ideas]] - generating and refining thoughts

See my [[Daily Notes]] for how I track learning progress.
