A collection of random thoughts, potential projects, and creative sparks.

- Personal dashboard aggregator

### Content Ideas

- Podcast about [[Learning Strategies]]

### Experiments

## Thought Fragments

> What if the [[Pomodoro Technique]] could be automated with AI? Adaptive time blocks based on task complexity.

> Combining [[Stoicism]] with modern productivity - there's a book idea here!

> Could apply [[Software Architecture]] principles to personal knowledge management?

## Idea Development Process

1. **Capture** - Write it down immediately
2. **Incubate** - Let it sit for a few days
3. **Connect** - Link to related notes
4. **Develop** - Expand into full note or project
5. **Execute** - Move to [[Projects]] if actionable

## Recent Connections

- [[Learning Strategies]] + [[Daily Notes]] = spaced repetition system
- [[Deep Work]] + [[Stoicism]] = unstoppable focus
- [[Zettelkasten Method]] + [[Software Architecture]] = modular thinking

## Sources of Ideas

- Books ([[Book Notes]])
- Conversations
- Shower thoughts
- Walking (movement is underrated!)
- Cross-pollination of different domains

Many ideas come from reviewing [[Daily Notes]] and spotting patterns.
