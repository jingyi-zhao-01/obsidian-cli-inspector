# Stoicism

Ancient philosophy focused on virtue, wisdom, and emotional resilience.

## Key Stoic Principles

- **Focus on what you can control** - Let go of the rest
- **Negative visualization** - Prepare for challenges
- **Voluntary discomfort** - Build resilience
- **View from above** - Maintain perspective

## Modern Applications

Stoicism complements [[Deep Work]] by building mental discipline. The ability to focus despite distractions is fundamentally stoic.

## Daily Practice

I incorporate stoic exercises into my [[Daily Notes]]:
- Morning reflection
- Evening review
- Gratitude journaling

## Connections

- [[Learning Strategies]] - patience and persistence
- [[Pomodoro Technique]] - discipline in time management
- [[Projects]] - resilience when facing setbacks
- [[Ideas]] - clarity of thought
