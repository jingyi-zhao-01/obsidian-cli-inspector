# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten (slip-box) method is a personal knowledge management system developed by Niklas Luhmann.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomicity** - One idea per note
2. **Autonomy** - Each note should be self-contained
3. **Connection** - Link notes liberally
4. **Develop Ideas Over Time** - Notes evolve

## Why It Works

The method mirrors how our brains work - through connections rather than hierarchies. This is why it integrates so well with [[Learning Strategies]].

## My Implementation

I use this method across all my notes:
- [[Home]] serves as the main index
- [[Deep Work]] and other concept notes are atomic
- Links create a web of knowledge

## Practical Applications

- Writing projects ([[Projects]])
- Research and study
- Idea generation ([[Ideas]])
- Book summaries ([[Book Notes]])

The key is consistency - I document this in my [[Daily Notes]].
