# Daily Notes

## Purpose

Daily notes serve as:
- Progress tracker for [[Projects]]
- Reflection space (inspired by [[Stoicism]])
- Learning log for [[Learning Strategies]]
- Habit tracker

## What I Track

### Productivity Metrics
- Pomodoros completed ([[Pomodoro Technique]])
- [[Deep Work]] hours
- Tasks completed

### Learning
- Key insights from reading ([[Book Notes]])
- New connections made ([[Zettelkasten Method]])
- Skills practiced ([[Software Architecture]])

### Reflection
- What went well
- What could improve
- Gratitude practice

## Recent Patterns

Over the last month, I've noticed:
- Morning deep work sessions are most productive
- Reading before bed improves sleep quality
- Regular breaks prevent burnout

## Connection to Other Notes

Daily notes are the glue that connects everything:
- [[Home]] - provides structure
- [[Projects]] - tracks execution
- [[Ideas]] - captures spontaneous thoughts
- [[Learning Strategies]] - applies theory
- [[Stoicism]] - frames mindset

## Template

Each day follows a simple template:
- Morning intention
- Time blocks
- Evening review
- Tomorrow's plan
