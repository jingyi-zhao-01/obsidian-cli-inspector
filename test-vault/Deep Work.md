# Deep Work

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. This concept was popularized by Cal Newport.

## Key Principles

1. **Work Deeply** - Schedule blocks of uninterrupted time
2. **Embrace Boredom** - Train your brain to resist distraction
3. **Quit Social Media** - Or at least be selective
4. **Drain the Shallows** - Minimize low-value activities

## Connection to Learning

Deep work is essential for [[Learning Strategies]]. When I'm in a flow state, I can absorb complex material much faster.
